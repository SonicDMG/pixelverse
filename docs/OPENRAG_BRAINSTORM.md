## Questions to Explore Together

1. **What excites you most?** Which idea makes you think "I want to build that!"?

2. **Who's the user?** Are we building for professionals, students, hobbyists, or everyone?

3. **What's the business model?** Free tool, freemium, B2B SaaS, marketplace?

4. **How much time?** Is this a weekend project, a month-long build, or a startup?

5. **What's unique?** Why would someone use this instead of ChatGPT with file uploads?

6. **What's the demo?** If you had to show this in 2 minutes, what would you show?

## My Gut Feeling

If I had to pick ONE to build right now, I'd go with **PixelLegal** because:

1. **Clear pain point**: Legal research is expensive and time-consuming
2. **High willingness to pay**: Lawyers bill $300-1000/hour
3. **Citations are critical**: Can't just hallucinate in legal work
4. **Existing tools are boring**: Westlaw/LexisNexis are powerful but not fun
5. **Differentiation**: The cyberpunk aesthetic + AI is unique in legal tech
6. **Data is available**: Court opinions are public domain
7. **Network effects**: Lawyers share tools with other lawyers

But that's just me! What resonates with you?
